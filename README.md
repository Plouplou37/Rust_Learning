## Rust Programming Language

---

The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software. High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle traditionally associated with such control.

This repository is just to store what I learn reading the following book: [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html)

After starting my professional journey as a Data Enigneer, I'm now missing working with low-level and complex technologies. I'm here looking to expand my knowledges and my tools kit to build exciting projects. Rust is the right candidate for this new challenge !

I've graduated in "Electronics and Digital Technologies" from Polytech Nantes the Great Engineering School of Nantes University. If I had to summarized this training, it would be to train higly-capable engineers able to bridge the gap between Hardware and Software. From Semi-Conductors to Embeded Systems (Design, Development, etc) !

My final ambition being to develop an OS using RUST ! :p
